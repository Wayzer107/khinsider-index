# khinsider-index
A static file containing a complete index of the content on downloads.khinsider.com

This repo runs the same index functionality built into my [khinsider](https://github.com/marcus-crane/khinsider/tree/v2) tool, just on a timer and uploaded as a file.

While any user can generate their own index if they choose, by default they'll download a tar gzipped version of the index that is generated and released against this repo, whenever any changes are detected.

Shout outs to [trackiam](https://github.com/glassechidna/trackiam) as inspiration. I've taken the idea a little further with automatic releasing of the files being watched though so feel free to poke around this repo too. I ran into a few gotchas that I've briefly documented.

I intend to write a fuller README in future
